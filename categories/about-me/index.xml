      <description>If you are reading this, chances are you&amp;rsquo;re one of my colleagues. Hello there ðŸ¤—&#xA;Perhaps you have noticed me sending private messages as Giannis, or Yannis. However, in official documents and professional settings, my name is listed as &amp;ldquo;Ioannis&amp;rdquo; ðŸ¤”&#xA;Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t possess multiple identities ðŸ˜„ My name is officially Î™Ï‰Î¬Î½Î½Î·Ï‚, which directly translates to English as Ioannis. However, this sounds too formal in common Greek, and thus its diminutive form, Î“Î¹Î¬Î½Î½Î·Ï‚, is preferred.</description>
