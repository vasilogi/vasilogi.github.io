      <description>This is my first post and instead of a proper introduction, I would like to clarify my name&amp;rsquo;s situation. I intend do that bacause many non-Greek friends and colleagues get confused since my name is different on official documents than how I normally write it.&#xA;The situation Formal and informal My ID name is Î™Ï‰Î¬Î½Î½Î·Ï‚ which directly translates to English as Ioannis. However, in common Greek &amp;ldquo;Ioannis&amp;rdquo; this name in Greek sounds too formal and thus its diminutive form, Î“Î¹Î¬Î½Î½Î·Ï‚, is preferred.</description>
