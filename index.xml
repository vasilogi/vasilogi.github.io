      <description>If you are reading this, chances are you&amp;rsquo;re one of my colleagues. Hello there ü§ó&#xA;Perhaps you have noticed me sending private messages as Giannis, or Yannis. However, in official documents and professional settings, my name is listed as &amp;ldquo;Ioannis&amp;rdquo; ü§î&#xA;Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t possess multiple identities üòÑ My name is officially ŒôœâŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ, which directly translates to English as Ioannis. However, this sounds too formal in common Greek, and thus its diminutive form, ŒìŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ, is preferred.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s undoubtedly an abundance of blogs and content about software and AI, which are currently my main interests. One might wonder why the world needs another such blog. The answer is simple: why not! I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start blogging (even if sporadically) for three main reasons: to enhance my writing, illustration, and communication skills; to share my interests with others; and to maintain focus through the discipline of writing.</description>
